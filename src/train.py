# Training Our Segmentation Model
"""
Now that we have implemented our dataset class and model architecture, we are ready to construct and train our
segmentation pipeline in PyTorch.

Specifically, we will be looking at the following in detail:

   Structuring the data-loading pipeline
   Initializing the model and training parameters
   Defining the training loop
   Visualizing the training and test loss curves

   Training is probably the trickiest part of the code. Let's see what the code does:

        We start by iterating through the number of epochs, and then the batches in our training data
        We convert the images and the labels according to the device we are using, i.e., GPU or CPU
        In the forward pass we make predictions using our model and calculate loss based on those predictions and our
        actual labels. Next, we do the backward pass where we actually update our weights to improve our model
        We then set the gradients to zero before every update using optimizer.zero_grad() function
        Then, we calculate the new gradients using the loss.backward() function
        And finally, we update the weights with the optimizer.step() function

        '''
        Next, we iterate over our trainLoader dataloader, which provides a batch of samples at a time. The training loop, 
        as shown as the following for loop, comprises of the following steps:
        
           First, on first statement of for loop, we move our data samples (i.e., x and y) to the device we are 
           training our model on, defined by config.DEVICE
           
           We then pass our input image sample x through our unet model on 2nd statement and get the output prediction 
           (i.e., pred)
           On third Line, we compute the loss between the model prediction, pred and our ground-truth label y
           On Lines starting at "opt.zero_grad()", we backpropagate our loss through the model and update the parameters
           This is executed with the help of three simple steps;
                we start by clearing all accumulated gradients from previous steps on Line "opt.zero_grad()". 
                Next, we call the backward method on our computed loss function as shown on Line "loss.backward()". This
                directs PyTorch to compute gradients of our loss w.r.t. all variables involved in the computation graph.
                Finally, we call opt.step() to update our model parameters.
           In the end, Line "totalTrainLoss += loss" enables us to keep track of our training loss by adding the loss 
           for the step to the totalTrainLoss variable, which accumulates the training loss for all samples.
        This process is repeated until iterated through all dataset samples once (i.e., completed one epoch).

        Once we have processed our entire training set, we would want to evaluate our model on the test set.

        training set.
    
        While evaluating our model on the test set, we do not track gradients since we will not be learning or 
        backpropagating. Thus we can switch off the gradient computation with the help of torch.no_grad() and

The loss should decrease with more and more epochs. This is a good sign. But if it is fluctuating at the end, 
this could mean the model is overfitting or that the batch_size is small. 
'''

'''
Once our model is trained, we will see a loss trajectory plot similar to the one shown in Figure 4. 
Notice that train_loss gradually reduces over epochs and slowly converges. 
Furthermore, we see that test_loss also consistently reduces with train_loss following similar trend and values, 
implying our model generalizes well and is not overfitting to the training set.

Machines learn by means of a loss function. Itâ€™s a method of evaluating how well specific algorithm models 
the given data. If predictions deviates too much from actual results, loss function would cough up a very 
large number. 
Gradually, with the help of some optimization function, loss function learns to reduce the error in prediction. 


Then we write the logic for our train function which executes over every batch of data. 
The code is pretty straightforward. Note that while training, we donâ€™t explicitly apply softmax on the 
predictions as the Cross-Entropy Loss function in PyTorch does that for us. 
The train function below is called for every epoch.

The main function in Python acts as the point of execution for any program. Defining the main function in Python 
programming is a necessity to start the execution of the program as it gets executed only when the program is run 
directly and not executed when imported as a module.

In Python, it is not necessary to define the main function every time you write a program. This is because the Python 
interpreter executes from the top of the file unless a specific function is defined. Hence, having a defined starting 
point for the execution of your Python program is useful to better understand how your program works.
